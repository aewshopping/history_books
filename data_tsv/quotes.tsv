0008353077	The total amount of silver dating to the Viking Age found on Gotland now exceeds a thousand kilograms - the weight of a compact car - and includes 168,000 coins.
0141010207	At least, unlike Munslow, I have written a fair amount of archive-based history on topics of, I would say, some significance. And, despite Munslow’s snide remarks… I am perhaps less conceited than Munslow would seem to be suggesting… According to Munslow my book is a sour diatribe against my fellow historians. On the contrary, it is a joyous celebration of the immense achievements of professional history… We need an understanding of the distant past as well as the recent. Do we need Munslow? One has to admire Munslow’s resilience. But does he really have to go on boring the pants off us?
0141010207	There is a common saying that when you are in a hole you should at some juncture cease excavating further. Marwick’s failure to adopt this policy is embarrassingly revealed in some of his throw away sentiments. I am astounded that he should say, for example, that John Warren is a defender of postmodernism, or that postmodernists don’t write books, or that historians are not idealist or materialist, just historians… There are many other regrettable /ludicrous/bizarre/funny/plainly wrong statements of this kind. I would like to say the book is worth the sale price just to find them as, dependent on your point of view, you may find them diverting, but as I got the book free to review I can’t really comment…
0141010207	You can, if you please, turn history into theology by making the meaning of the past depend on some extra-historical and super-rational power. You can, if you please, turn it into literature – a collection of stories and legends about the past without meaning or significance. History properly so-called can be written only by those who find and accept a sense of direction in history itself. The belief that we have come from somewhere is closely linked with the belief that we are going somewhere. A society which has lost belief in its capacity to progress in the future will quickly cease to concern itself with its progress in the past
0190059044	His name [Sargon] was a fiction. It meant “the king is legitimate” - just the kind of name you’d want if you actually were not a legitimate king at all.
0190673060	When he got to the dance floor, Axayacatl lifted up one foot, completely happy in hearing the music, and began to dance and move in circles
0190875348	...an invader with no local god to help him had made unwinnable wars on priests, monkeys and rivers.
0192859560	Caesar eroded the ability of the Senate to adjudicate future disputes. And yet the chain reaction of partisanship was not the creation of one politician alone. Cato's obstruction and boycotts were in their own way revolutionary and damaging, both inciting Caesar's escalation and precluding any alternative solution. In trying to throttle Caesar, Cato had throttled compromise, an essential feature of politics.
0192859560	Politicians can and must argue with each other all the time. But regularly staking out extreme positions, while perhaps rewarding for an individual politician’s career, threatens to devastate the political system overall... Leaders recklessly issue ultimatums that limit the options for everyone. They might even resort to physical violence. Polarisation does not have to end in civil war. But a major civil war starts with it.
0197555845	If the Civil War was a re-enactment of the American Revolution, Lincoln was playing George III.
0197555845	We hold these truths to be self evident; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
0197648002	Contact with Europeans introduced diseases so virulent that, once infected, local populations could suffer mortalities of 60 percent or more in a matter of weeks, or months at most. Vast tracts of the continent were abandoned as shattered communities became scattered bands of refugees... Whole cultures dissipated or were reinvented by bands of survivors.
0197648002	It is up to each reader to decide whether Ingram’s legacy as a slaver is adequately balanced by his legacy as a sympathetic observer of the people he encountered in Africa and in the Americas.
0197648002	The truth is rarely pure and never simple. Modern life would be very tedious if it were either, and [writing history] a complete impossibility!
0198715951	GREAT CONSPIRACY. Today would have been one of the greatest events that France has ever known if conspiracy had had its way.

0199858683	tribute on their backs, to seek the peace of His Majesty, desirous of his sweet breath of life. A notable event! [The like of this occurrence] had not been heard of since the time of the demigods: this land which knew not Egypt was supplicating the Good God!
0241413389	...if our hearts shall turn away, so that we will not obey, but shall be seduced, and worship other Gods, our pleasure and profits, and serve them... we shall surely perish out of the good land whither we pass over this vast sea to possess it.
0241413389	Colonists across New England contemplated their own sins and misdemeanours while censuring others, a desire for unity and uniformity mixing with righteous anger, nervous guilt and rank hypocrisy.
0241413389	the Connecticut valley was dotted with marshes and woods, marbled with streams and bounded by distant misty mountains. It was wondrous, yet terrifying in solitude.
0241413389	They are quite willing to accept that there’s going to be a hostile environment, and weather, and native Americans, and all the things that threaten them. The one thing that they always forget is that they will hate each other.

0241552176	Because they could.
0241552176	Canute knew perfectly well that he couldn’t control the waves. But he wanted to remind his advisers that God, not man, was the master of all. Whether it really happened, we will never know. But if it didn’t, perhaps it should have done.
0295750243	Acid deposition had scorched two thousand square miles of surrounding forests. Air and water sampling revealed pollution levels exceeding Russian standards by more than an order of magnitude. Life expectancies for Norilsk employees were ten years below the Russian average
030020633X	Because of the very nature of that deeply networked system, shock waves could not be contained. The Atlantic world was so imbricated that it was folly to believe that one crisis over sovereignty that had turned into revolution would remain isolated. The logic of the system would not allow it. What followed would with time demonstrate just how knotted the world had become.
030020633X	It's history is the creation of a world.
030020633X	What did it mean to be Bolivian? Or Mexican? Most of the markers of national attachment - say, religion, ethnicity, or language - were shared by so many states that had warred with each other. In most cases, states were built because of the practical considerations of the moment, but belonging and attachment required more.
0300253583	[Henry II’s] eldest daughter, Matilda, was married to the elderly Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony; they had a daughter and four sons. The second, Eleanor, was queen of Castile via her marriage to Alfonso VIII; she had so far borne him six children, of whom only two daughters survived. She would go on to have more, her eventual family consisting of six daughters and two sons who would live long enough to reach their teens, although she would sadly outlive a number of these, too. And finally, Henry II’s youngest daughter, Joanna, was the queen of Sicily as the wife of William II. She had at present no children (although it is possible that she had given birth to one stillborn or short-lived son); after William’s childless death she would be married again, to Count Raymond VI of Toulouse, with whom she would have two surviving children, a son and a daughter. We will hear more of all three of these women’s families in due course.
0300253583	Loyalty might be inspired or coerced in a huge variety of ways, including popularity, martial prowess, inspirational leadership, effective governance, trustworthiness or plain fear. John’s problem was that he proved to be spectacularly bad at all of them.
0340794704	In the course of his reign, he had overseen the deaths of thousands of men and women, a number of whom had been butchered by his own hand. He had ordered countless courtiers to be dragged behind mules until they were dead and had slain dozens of his imperial guard. Several of his sons had been put to death, and he had maimed and mutilated many of his wives. At least two of his subjects had been sawn in two, and numerous kaids and officers had lost eyes and limbs. But Moulay Ismail reserved the greatest contempt for his slaves, who had been butchered and tortured, mutilated and broken.
0367460998	These half civilised governments such as those in China Portugal and Spanish America all require a Dressing every eight or Ten years to keep them in order... They care little for words and they must not only see the Stick but actually feel it on their Shoulders.
0500252521	He [Zara Yaqob, an important Ethiopian king] invented a new model for Church-state relations, in which the secular state was the dominant force, creating an indigenous absolutism based upon the concept of Solomonic legitimacy. He reformed the Church in ways that unified the country, thereby further consolidating royal power.”
0500252521	The real puzzle of Nubia’s ancient history... is not whether it developed states or empires like those of neighbouring pharaonic Egypt. Rather, it is how its population managed to prevent the emergence of similar forms of domination in their own midst, despite the existence of Egyptian models of governance on their doorstep and the effects of recurring Egyptian predation on their people and resources.
0571311989	According to the chroniclers, on the night of 21 September [1327], at Berkeley Castle, they smothered Edward [II] under a huge weight of feather pillows, and then, to ensure that he was dead without leaving a mark on his body, inserted a red-hot iron into his intestines via a horn introduced into his rectum.
0571311989	From the arrogant, lazy and somewhat feckless young man of the early reign, he developed into a paranoid, vindictive and vengeful tyrant.
0674238214	Big moment, big moment.
0674238214	I am frightened and ashamed, and there is no way I can be forgiven... I never imagined I would escape blame and punishment, yet Permission has been granted to supply timber. With the command to dispatch men to receive it, I am emotionally overcome in the extreme and rendered utterly speechless...
0674244214	What benefit do we derive from all these stores [tens of thousands of bars of silver]? They have to be constantly guarded. Have it announced that everybody who wants a bar should come and take one!

0674988183	Writing systems and conventions are culturally and historically meaningful, and the alphabet’s contribution came precisely at a time when Phoenician culture was highly influential, when the economic power and reach of Tyre [the pre-eminent Phoenician city state] was at its height, and when doing things “in the Phoenician way” (*phoinikizein*) was not stigmatised but desirable.
0691177112	The Dutch present ships have arrived at the Tiger’s Mouth,  like tall inns on the oyster-shell mirror of the water, a joyful noise ringing out.  They’re filled with precious offerings, but first they must transmit their official document, wrapped in gold.    荷兰贡舶虎门收,蠔镜声嚣水上楼。  琛献先传金叶表,翎开还整翠云裘。
0691192138	And Gandalf said: ‘...The Third Age of the world is ended, and the new age is begun; and it is your task to order its beginning and to preserve what may be preserved. For though much has been saved, much must now pass away…’
0691192138	I conquered the city. I felled 800 of their combat troops with the sword and cut off their heads. I captured many soldiers alive. The rest of them I burnt. I carried off valuable tribute from them. I built a pile of live men and of heads before his gate. I impaled on stakes 700 soldiers before their gate. I razed, destroyed, and turned into ruin hills the city. I burnt their adolescent boys and girls.
0691192138	Like a storm demon I piled up the corpses of their warriors on the battlefield and made their blood flow into the hollows and plains of the mountains. I cut off their heads and stacked them like grain piles around their cities.
0691208018	...it sounds nice, but does it advance our understanding? Is it more than just a fancy way to state a fairly obvious fact, namely that complicated things can break down in a variety of ways?
0691208018	In addition to its primary cargo of ten tons of Cypriot copper, one ton of tin, and a ton of terebinth resin, there were also two dozen ebony logs from Nubia; almost two hundred ingots of raw glass from Mesopotamia, most colored dark blue, but others of light blue, purple, and even a shade of honey/amber; about 140 Canaanite storage jars in two or three basic sizes, which contained the terebinth resin, remains of grapes, pomegranates, and figs, as well as spices like coriander and sumac; brand-new pottery from Cyprus and Canaan, including oil lamps, bowls, jugs, and jars; scarabs from Egypt and cylinder seals from elsewhere in the Near East; swords and daggers from Italy and Greece... and even a stone scepter-mace from the Balkans. There was also gold jewelry, including pendants, and a gold chalice; duck-shaped ivory cosmetic containers; copper, bronze, and tin bowls and other vessels; twenty-four stone anchors; fourteen pieces of hippopotamus ivory and one elephant tusk; and a six-inch-tall statue of a Canaanite deity made of bronze overlaid with gold in places - which, if it was supposed to serve as the protective deity for the ship, didn’t do its job very well.
0691208018	Moreover, you, my brother... as to the gold I wrote you about, send me whatever is on hand, as much as possible, before your messenger [comes] to me, right now, in all haste... If during this summer, during the months of Tammuz or Ab, you send the gold I wrote you about, I will give you my daughter.
0750997362	Little Alamayou is a very pretty, slight, graceful boy of 7 with beautiful eyes and a nice nose and mouth, though the lips are slightly thick. His skin is a dark bronze. His hair, which has been shaved, is crisp and curly. There is nothing of the negro about him. I kissed him which he returned. He can say one or two words in English.
075099889X	It takes a village to raise a child, and it takes a nation to create entrenched, violent organised crime. The people prosecuting these murders had a hand in creating the system that wrought this violence, with electoral gamesmanship and draconian, reactionary laws.
075099889X	The teabags that we nonchalantly put in our mugs every morning are full of deep historical blood.
1408706954	Puritans, then, even as they rejected the old and familiar, could not entirely deny a lurking paradox: that their rejection of tradition was itself a Christian tradition.
1408706989	She [Sporus] was a symbol not just of imperial power, but of the daring required to reach after imperial power. Well might those who had moulded her, fashioning an empress out of a boy, think nothing beyond them.
1408706989	Trajan, model of discipline and modesty that he was, had no patience with luxury. His only vices were those appropriate to an honest soldier: alcohol and boys.
145166883X	Nero was the most cultivated and cruelest emperor Rome had seen… Nero’s predecessors, aristocrats all, were more martial and sometimes madder, but none was more magnificent.
147118367X	Pizarro’s armada... too, had been almost completely wiped out by storms. One warship with five hundred men had vanished. Another, with seven hundred, had sunk. Because of delays from the weather, the three remaining warships had run out of food—sailors had started catching rats and selling them to one another for four dollars apiece. Most of the seamen had eventually starved to death. And Pizarro, after snuffing out a mutiny and executing three of the conspirators, had ordered his few surviving men to turn back.
1471188019	...in the later fourth millennium BCE, it seems that cereal cultivation was abandoned and there was a switch to more nomadic pastoralism... And along with that, there was a population collapse. Long barrows fell out of use. Causewayed enclosures fell into ruin. Fields were abandoned... this is the background to the arrival of the Beaker complex in Britain [i.e. the arrival of the Amesbury Archer and his associates] - it follows that Neolithic population collapse.
1474615775	You have reckoned that history ought to judge the past and to instruct the contemporary world as to the future. The present attempt does not yield to that high office. It will merely tell how it really was.
1501154559	By 1907, foreigners [mostly from the US] owned an estimated 60 percent of all rural property in Cuba. Resident Spaniards owned another 15 percent, which left only a quarter of rural property under Cuban ownership. The number is... staggering
1501154559	It [history] can never be understood only as the memory of states
1501154559	No circumstances cou’d possibly have happened more opportunely in point of time. The Commanding Officers of Corps are to cause abstracts to be immediately made for a month’s pay.
1526615649	...the thudding footsteps of the royal elephants outside, the animal scent of hay and leather from the Persian horses snorting their impatience, mingled with the cool water sprayed in the air, perfumed with the attar of rose and jasmine, the music of the naubat floating from the naqqar khana, ‘solemn, grand, and melodious’
1526615649	Ah Rahim, now you’re perplexed. Stick to truth and you lose the world, stick to lies and you never get Ram.
1526623811	Resisting this power [of the Assyrian kings] by means of military or political action was futile, and so the Hebrew priests and prophets did something else: they projected it onto their own god... This political-theological ‘transfer’ was a revolutionary move that inaugurated a new type of religion.
1526623811	Whoever is late will be impaled in his own house, and his sons and his daughters too shall be slaughtered.
1541617622	Surrounded by textiles, we’re largely oblivious to their existence and the knowledge and efforts embodied in every scrap of fabric.

1781858888	Whether this orgy of anti-Semitic violence was inspired by the crusaders’ widely shared agenda of revenging Christ’s betrayal... or whether it simply represented the bloodlust of a frenzied mob who could not wait to exercise their religious fury is probably unanswerable.
1783352647	_Ignite the Cultural Revolution!_ The words appeared on a big-character poster attacking Peking University’s leadership: an arresting handwritten protest[^1]. Within hours, on Mao’s instruction, it was read over the radio. And in the heat of his encouragement it all burst into life, scrawled white sheets blossoming across the walls of schools and colleges. Lecture and lessons were cancelled, the students freed.
1783352647	The scar ran through the heart of Chinese society, and through the souls of its citizens. The Cultural Revolution was a national trauma as well as a mass of personal ones.
1783352647	They f*ck you up, your mum and dad.  They may not mean to, but they do.  They fill you with the faults they had  And add some extra, just for you.   But they were f*cked up in their turn  By fools in navy-blue one-piece suits,  Who half the time were marxist-stern  And half at one another’s throats.
1783528052	We must keep talking about sex. We must keep educating children about sex, and not just about what happens when a sperm gets its hands on an egg. We must talk about consent, pleasure, masturbation, pornography, love, relationships and our own bodies. Because the only way we will dispel shame is to drag sex out in the open and have a good long look at it. History has shown us how damaging shaming sexual practices, in all their myriad forms, can be.
1783528052	You feel like you have a cold – shivering, aching, nauseous – and have the hair-trigger emotions of someone who has not slept for days… The intense cramping across your lower abdomen feels like the worst diarrhoea you’ve ever had – in fact, you’ll also get diarrhoea, to help with the crying fits. As your internal organs contract and tear themselves to blooded bits so you can lay an egg, blasts of searing pain rip through you. Sometimes they’re so bad, you double over and can’t breathe until it’s passed, and the dull, constant ache returns… You bleed so much that all ‘intimate feminine hygiene products’ fail you – it’s like trying to control a lava flow with an oven mitt. You worry people can smell your period. You are terrified to sit on anything or stand up for a week in case you’ve bled through. And as you’re sitting, a crying, sweaty, wobbly, spotty, smelly mess, some bastard asks ‘Time of the month, love?’ And then you have to eat his head.
1783784598	I will look humbly at the past and say despite them all: it really happened, and we really can, if we are very scrupulous and careful and self-critical, find out how it happened and reach some tenable though always less than final conclusions about what it all meant.
1783784598	while a chemist… knows in advance the result of mixing two elements… the historian has no such advance knowledge of anything, nor is trying to gain such knowledge central to the business historians are engaged in.
1785786628	In the first two years of the establishment of slavery on Hispaniola [the ‘New World’ discovered by Columbus], an estimated 50,000 natives died from disease, starvation and overwork. Tens of thousands more chose to take their own lives rather than endure the hellish system of enslavement established by Columbus. In 1492 Hispaniola was home to anywhere between 300,000 and 1 million indigenous people. By 1548 that number had dropped to about 500. An entire people were lost within a single lifetime.
1785786628	it’s impossible to deny the role of history in shaping our perceptions of society, both past and present…. History, whether we like it or not, has an annoying habit of being relevant.
1785789546	How much the greatest event it is that ever happened in the world! and how much the best!
1788168828	Because ship tracks, unlike land routes, are artificial constructs. The foamy wake left behind by a vessel can only become a solid line if one adopts a specific cartographical mindset. The fact that pre-modern people privileged other ways of reporting navigation shows that this mindset is not universal.
1788168828	Born of imperial arrogance, solidified through colonial technology, and manifested through environmental pollution: both precarious and violent, tracks embody many of the contradictions inherent to modern mobility.
1788168828	In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the world suddenly stretched under Europeans’ feet... Maps were recruited in understanding and apportioning this novel immense space... The world was a theatre to human action... But now it was also something that humans made, and ruled from above.
1789544149	Once the circle of timbers and the inverted central oak tree had been set in place, the funeral rites could begin. The body would have been carried into the shrine through the single narrow entranceway. It was probably then ceremoniously place on top of the inverted tree roots, which formed an outstretched, hand-like surface… I have often written about the extraordinary smell of tannin on the air when I first entered the completed reconstruction of the Seahenge timber enclosure… One must imagine such a strong smell during the ceremonies, compounded no doubt by darkness, fire and the sound of rhythmical drumming.
1800818297	...seats would be demolished, windows shattered; there’d be pools of blood on the carpet, torn ears, fingers and penises, countless dead apes throughout the plane, and great howling and gnashing of teeth.
1800818297	A species that kills its most belligerent, aggressive and ruthless members over hundreds of generations creates a strong selection pressure in favour of peacefulness, tolerance and impulse control. We are the descendants of the friendliest.
1800818297	Belief in the authority of moralising gods... played a key role in the emergence of early advanced civilizations
1800818297	The notion that some people are simply too stupid or irrational to distinguish true from false is inaccurate and self-righteous – because of course, only other people are irrational and deluded. In reality, we are all mere consumers of cumulative cultural capital that holds us hostage in informational captivity. The processes that lead some people to adopt fake news are, counterintuitive though it sounds, completely rational - the same mechanisms are at work that we have used to acquire any other form of knowledge.
1800818297	We don’t disagree - we just hate each other.
1805260197	Love is the great unraveller - love that expects nothing in return; and the immemorial heresy of the human mind is egoism... All egoism is in some measure insane, and what we admit to be insanity is but egoism overdriven.
1837730245	...no statement could be made about the buttocks regarding clothing
1837730245	By shifting our focus to the way people moved, we infuse the past with the dynamism and vital force it once contained, letting it live in the present.
1838934820	for peasants, too, clothing was a marker of status, and in a sense a badge advertising their political capital and potency, which is to say that in general they had none.
1846144663	The unique representation of Justinian and Theodora right in the sanctuary of a very unusual octagonal church was their response to Theodoric’s blazing presence in his golden palace church… But… the images of the heretic Arian king and his courtiers were cut away. The central space that had been Theodoric’s was filled with gold tesserae… Of Theodoric’s portrait not even a fingernail survives.
