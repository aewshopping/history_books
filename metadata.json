When this loads type 'Aztecs' in the search box. That should kick things off.</p><p>If you know SQL you can do all sorts - this database uses SQLite. If you don't but you want to get an idea of how you can make queries <a href='https://datasette.io/tutorials/learn-sql'>this is a good place to start</a>.</p><p>Here are some notes on <a href='https://github.com/aewshopping/history_books/'>how this is all put together</a>, plus the backing csv data for those who are interested.</p><p>Anthony Webb, London</p><br><br><br>",
